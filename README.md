# Caesar Cipher and SHA512 for Computer Networks
In `Python`

## Implementation of Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique where all letters in a message are shifted down the alphabet by a certain number, which is a key `k`. In the Caesar cipher, the key is the number of places to shift each character.

##  SHA-512

To better understand Secure Hash Algoritms (SHA), I used the BitVector module to create an implementation of SHA-512. In this repo, you can find input.txt that was tested with SHA-512, and the output in output.txt
